Hi there :wave:

I'm a climate scientist by training, with a focus on the ocean's role in the climate system. Since finishing university in 2017, I've mostly worked as a data scientist — both in academia and industry.

Most recently, I was involved in physics-informed causal inference projects, aiming to understand the drivers and impacts of extreme events. I'm results-oriented and thrive in both independent and collaborative settings, often taking initiative while also contributing hands-on. With experience across the full data science pipeline — from data acquisition and exploratory analysis to model development, testing, reporting, and deployment — I bring a practical, end-to-end approach to solving complex problems.

I'm currently looking for a new challenge where I can help uncover insights, assess risks and opportunities, and support data-driven decision-making.
